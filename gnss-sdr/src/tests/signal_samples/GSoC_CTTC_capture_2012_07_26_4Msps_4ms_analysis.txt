Signal capturing:

Hardware: USRP1 + DBSRX daughterboard (Rev 4.5) + Antenna Novatel GPS-600. The USRP1 uses its internal 64 MHz onboard reference for deriving the sampling clock.

Location: Roof of the Centre Tecnol√≤gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), (40.396764 N, 3.713379 E), located at the Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Av. Carl Friedrich Gauss, 7, 08860 Castelldefels, Barcelona, Spain.

Signal capture utility: we used the Universal Hardware Driver (UHD). 
UHD driver capture to file example located in uhd/host/build/examples/$.rx_samples_to_file

File sink:
In order to avoid buffer overflows the target destination for the capture file was a 4 GB RAM unit (in a system equipped with 8 GB of RAM). The linux command used to setup the RAM drive was:
$ mkdir /tmp/ram
$ mount -t tmpfs -o size=4G tmpfs /tmp/ram

The command for capturing data was:

$ ./rx_samples_to_file --file /tmp/ram/usrpcap1.dat --type short --freq 1575420000 --gain 50 --rate 8000000 --nsamps 800000000

This captures samples in interleaved (I&Q) short format (signed 16-bits, or 2 bytes), which is still not implemented in GNSS-SDR. Thus, the file was converted to gr_complex using a simple script in GNU Radio Companion.
